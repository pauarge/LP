# LP

This is a repository for the Programming Languages (LP, in Catalan) course Facultat d'Inform√†tica de Barcelona (UPC - BarcelonaTech). It contains the three projects:

* **Compilers**, in which we build an interpreter for a simple blocks language, using PCCTS.
* **Functional programming**, in which we build an interpreter using PCCTS and Haskell.
* **Scripting**, in which we build an XML parser for Barcelona's Town Hall data using Python.

Each project includes a PDF with the instructions of the assignment (in Catalan).
